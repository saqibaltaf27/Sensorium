Sensorium: Real-Time Data Intelligence Platform
Overview

Sensorium is a state-of-the-art data intelligence platform for real-time monitoring, visualization, and management of physical assets. It transforms raw sensor data into actionable insights through a robust three-tier architectureâ€”ensuring data integrity, scalability, and performance.

At its core, Sensorium combines:

Python-based ingestion service for resilient device communication

Node.js/Express API for secure data distribution

React.js dashboard for real-time visualization and insights

This unified stack delivers a scalable, future-ready platform for organizations seeking intelligent operational oversight.

Architecture

Sensoriumâ€™s architecture is designed for resilience, speed, and extensibility.

1. Ingestion & Persistence Layer (Python + SQL Server)

Custom Python service deployed as an NSSM Windows service

Autonomous collection of data from diverse sensors

Reliable persistence in SQL Server for historical tracking

Fail-safe design to minimize data loss

2. Service & Distribution Layer (Node.js/Express)

High-efficiency RESTful API

Optimized for low latency and high throughput

Provides secure, scalable access to stored data

Acts as the central nervous system of the platform

3. Presentation & Insight Layer (React.js)

Modern, responsive dashboard with real-time data feeds

Clear, actionable visualization of KPIs and trends

Built-in custom loading animations for premium UX

Strategic design for both operators and decision-makers

Key Features

Real-Time Monitoring â€“ Continuous, fail-safe ingestion of sensor data

Actionable Insights â€“ Transform raw data into clear, meaningful KPIs

Scalable & Resilient â€“ Designed to handle increasing device and data loads

Modern UI/UX â€“ Responsive dashboard with intuitive visualization
